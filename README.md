# Advent of Code

See http://adventofcode.com/

In my day to day life I use PHP. This is an attempt to do things in
Java as well. Maybe I'll do them in other languages as well.

# My rules

The rules that I'm going with is that each of the example inputs
*must* be used as unit test cases. This means that I'm getting
something useful out of it.
